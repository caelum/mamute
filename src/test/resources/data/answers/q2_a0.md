    (0...8).map{(65+rand(26)).chr}.join

I spend too much time golfing.

    (0...50).map{ ('a'..'z').to_a[rand(26)] }.join

For lots of good WTFBBQ factor.

And a last one that's even more confusing, but more flexible and wastes less cycles:

    o =  [('a'..'z'),('A'..'Z')].map{|i| i.to_a}.flatten
    string  =  (0...50).map{ o[rand(o.length)] }.join
