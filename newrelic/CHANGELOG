CHANGELOG
=========

v2.16.0
-------

* Adds a stack trace in a transaction trace for methods taking longer than
  the stack trace threshold setting (in seconds).
  
    transaction_tracer:
      stack_trace_threshold: 1.0

* Cross Application Tracing support for HttpURLConnection.

  Adds request and response headers to external calls using the
  HttpURLConnection library to provided better performance data
  when calling applications monitored by other New Relic Agents
  (Java, .NET, and Ruby, with others coming soon).

* Fix: Cross Application Tracing does not correlate consistently when using
  WebSphere, WebLogic, Resin, and Glassfish.
 
  Cross Appplication Tracing did not correlate calling and called applications
  when the HTTP response was large.

* Queuing time more broadly supported.

  The 'X-Queue-Start' and 'X-Request-Start' request headers for Heroku and other
  front-end web servers are interpreted and reported.  Previously, queuing time
  was not reported for Heroku.
  
* Adds a config setting to turn off class transforming after the given number
  of seconds. This is a work-around for an Oracle JVM bug that in rare cases 
  can cause native memory leaks.

    class_transformer:
      shutdownDelay: 3600
  
v2.15.1
-------
 
* Fix: Cross Application Tracing does not correlate consistently when using Tomcat 6+
 
  Cross Appplication Tracing did not correlate calling and called applications
  when the called application ran in Tomcat 6 or later and the HTTP response was
  greater than about 7k.
 
 v2.15.0
-------

* Cross Application Tracing

  The Cross Application Tracing feature adds request and response headers to
  external calls using the Apache HttpClient libraries to provided better
  performance data when calling applications monitored by other New Relic
  Agents (Java, .NET, and Ruby, with others coming soon).
  
  The 2.14.0 release links aggregated data across applications. This release
  also links transaction traces.
  
  The configuration setting introduced in 2.14.0 to enable/disable Cross
  Application Tracing in newrelic.yml has changed. The old setting:
  'cross_application_tracing: true' is deprecated. The new setting is
  
  cross_application_tracer:
    enabled: true
    
  The default setting is true. Set to false to disable Cross Application
  Tracing.
  
* Instrumentation added for the AmazonS3Client version 1.x

  The New Relic Agent now offers support for version 1.0 to current of the
  com.amazonaws.services.s3.AmazonS3 interface. 

* New Relic Java Agent support a daily roll over log

  To roll over the agent log every day, set the property log_daily to true.
  Set the property log_file_count to the number of day logs you would like to
  keep.
  
* New Relic Java Agent now communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default rather than HTTP

  If you have an existing installation and wish to use HTTPS to communicate
  with New Relic, edit your newrelic.yml file to include
  
  ssl: true
  
  in the common section. We recommend this for existing customers in order to
  improve the security of your communications with New Relic.
  
* Java Agent installer improvements

  The Java Agent installer now supports JBoss 7.x AS and JBoss 6.x EAP in
  standalone mode. Instructions for manually installing the Java Agent on
  JBoss 7.x AS and JBoss 6.x EAP can be found at
  https://newrelic.com/docs/java/installing-the-java-agent-on-jboss
  
* Fix: Default hostname reported

  This release reverts the change in 2.14.0 that effected the way that the
  hostname is reported. With this release, the agent reports the default
  hostname rather than short form in order to correlate with New Relic server
  monitoring.
  
* Fix: Web transactions naming in Spring MVC version 3.x

  This bug caused customers using Spring 3.0.1 and above to often have web
  transactions named by the servlet rather than controller method. This has
  been fixed such that a separate metric is created for each controller
  method.

  
v2.14.1
-------
 
* Fix: Application errors using java.net.HttpURLConnection.
  The bug, introduced in 2.14.0, could cause errors in code that uses java.net.HttpURLConnection.
  Possible errors could occur in XML parsing, incorrect http response status, or BeanCreationException in Spring. 
  As part of this fix the agent does not add a 'X-NewRelic-ID' header to outbound requests using java.net.HttpURLConnection.


v2.14.0
-------

* Fix: New Relic includes property take_last_status to only grab the final http status code.

    By default, New Relic reports any error status code. However, when this property is set to true, only
    the last http status code will be reported. This property should be set when using Apache Felix.

* Fix: New Relic now correctly patches Apache Felix ClassLoaders.

* Fix: Time will now display correctly for the first hour of the day when using log4j.

* Fix: RUM header was missing a semicolon at the end of the last statement.  Some browsers prefer semicolons everywhere.

* Adds a 'X-NewRelic-ID' header to outbound requests using the Apache HttpClient or HttpURLConnection libraries.
  This change helps improve the correlation of performance between services in a service-oriented architecture for a forthcoming feature.
  In the meantime, if you wish to disable the header, set 'cross_application_tracing: false' in newrelic.yml.
  
* Fix: Java agent now reports hostnames consistent with the output of "hostname -s" to match all other agents

* Add report of physical server memory (in addition to JVM memory) on Unix/Linux machines


v2.13.0
--------

* Agent can be configured to not send JVM arguments to the New Relic server

  The property send_jvm_props can be set to false, which will cause JVM arguments to no longer be sent to the server. Use this setting if you set sensitive system properties on the command line.
 
* Agent reports full URL in external service calls for transaction traces

  The agent now will provide the full URL if available in transaction traces for external calls.
  
* Fix: ResinServletTracerFactory no longer causing SkipServletTracerFactory errors

  When hitting the ResinServletTracerFactory inside a transaction, a SkipServletTracerFactory excetion will no longer be thrown.
  
* Agent logging improvements

  We have improved the clarity of logging messages, adjusted logging levels to be more appropriate, and increased logging performance.
  

v2.12.0
-------
* Agent reports jars used by applications to the Environments tab in the UI

  The Environments tab in the New Relic UI now shows the jars used by your application.

* Fix: In certain cases, auto-RUM of JSP broke HTML

  An angle-bracket in quotes in a META tag causes the agent to produced invalid HTML for JSP. The agent now produces valid HTML for this case.

* Fix: Key Transaction ApdexT value was not used

  In v2.10 - v2.11, the application-level ApdexT value was used for Key Transactions rather than the ApdexT for the Key Transaction itself. In this release, the ApdexT for the Key Transaction is used as designed.

* Fix: With OC4J using PolicyClassLoader, no metrics were displayed

  In the case where OC4J uses the PolicyClassLoader, the agent generated a java.lang.StackOverflowError in the log and did not provide metrics. In this release, the error does not occur.

* Fix: External metrics for HttpClient included port if host was an IP address

  In the case where an external service call used HttpClient with an IP address rather than a hostname, the port number was also included. In this release, the port number is not displayed.

v2.8.0
  * Supports basic proxy authentication for the case where there is a proxy server between the agent and the Internet.
